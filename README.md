## How to edit site and see changes locally after editing

  Clone repo and edit it using any text editor.  Install
  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (in Ubuntu you can just type `apt install
  jekyll`) and run `jekyll serve` in repo directory.

## I don't understand how it works

  [GitHub supports Jekyll sites out of the
  box](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/). To
  understand file organization, read Jekyll
  [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). You don't need to understand
  Jekyll to contribute to the site, but you need to understand HTML and
  Markdown. You can just edit existing content or create new content using
  existing content as a template. For example, you can create a new post by
  copying existing post `.md` file in `_posts` and making appropriate changes.
  You can create a new project by copying existing `.md` file in `projects` and
  adding a link to it in `projects/index.html`. You can also try to use
  [prose](http://prose.io/) for editing, buy it's not recommended.
